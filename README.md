# SOME tools

Here is a project of, indeed, "some tools" for seismic routines and plotting analysis.

VERSION: _0.0.5_

DATE: 02-2022


### Plotting
This folder contains, at the moment, modules and routines for static plotting
of _maps_, _depth-sections_, and _elevation profiles_.

Please refer to the book of interest for API and configuration file
descriptions.

This package is intended for preliminary layers of plotting with PyGMT
and fast/quick check of the database at hands. All of the plotting
routines returns a `pygmt.Figure` instance that can be used later for
additional plotting.

### Books

- `PlottingTrace.ipynb`: to plot seismograms and picks
- `PlottingMap.ipynb`: to plot epicentral map
- `PlottingSections.ipynb`: to plot depth-sections and elevation-profiles
- `ConfigFile_README.md`: configuration file (YAML) or ditionary explanation
